# Digital Adult Content Token
#### A Cryptocurrency Token for the Adult Games and Art Community

## What is a cryptocurrency token?
A token is a cryptocurrency that is easy to create. They are created using the platforms created by a real cryptocurrency projects. We would create one to launch our own currency for use in our own community. This token would have all of the features and functionality of a real cryptocurrency, without the complicated software development that goes into creating a cryptocurrency from scratch.

Basically, it is magic internet money that we can do whatever we want with.

## This sound complicated...

I know right!! It can seem overwhelming at first, but it is actually very easy to use it... This is a quick demonstration of how simple it would be for you and your followers to use this token.

In this example we will be using goby, a browser extension-based crypto wallet. There are several different wallets that you could use, goby is just one option that shows how simple all of this can be.

### Just install goby in google chrome

### Open goby, and set a password

### Write down your private mnemonic, and keep it safe.
It can be used to access this new wallet from anywhere, even if your computer is lost or destroyed. (Don't share it with anyone, they could use it to steal everything in the wallet)

### And, that's it...
This is your new address, which can be copied and shared publicly with anyone who wants to send you tokens

It really is just that simple.

## What will this project look like?

We will create 1 billion of this new token, and set up two system to distribute them over time. One will be designed in a way that supports current and future creators for decades to come. The other will be set up to support community growth, platform development, and other fun stuff.

The goal of this is to help form a fun, light hearted, and open economy between creators and their audiences.

## What will this economy look like?
Creators will be encouraged to distribute some of their tokens to their Patreon subscribers and other supporters as rewards. Creators would also offer their audiences various products, services, and just silly, fun things to do in exchange for these token. Platforms like spicygaming.net, myself, and other software developers in the community will create tools and services to make things easier for creators and more fun for the community.

This economy would not immediately make us rich, or replace our existing income streams. It will mostly just be a fun way to reward our supportors and play around with the technology. However, over time, as more people get involved and this economy grows, demand for the token will rise.

## How will creators make money with this?
The token will be worthless when it is created. It's value will come from it's use, and its price will go up as demand for the token grows. Tokens are are a [zero sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) Which basically means the price goes up when people want to buy, and down when people want to sell. So the questions are "Who wants to buy? Who wants to sell? And why?" It is basic supply and demand.

Because of the Creator Fund (and the Community Fund) a large community of individual creators will hold and control most of the supply. Therefor, they will benifit the most, as they should. If outside investors, or players want to buy more of the token, they will have to either earn it by supporting us, or buy it from us, because we control the majority of the supply. It is the balance between buy pressure and sell pressure that determines the price of the token. This is a bit complicated, but that is just how markets work.

On an individual level, you as a creator would be given a chunk of the token for free that you can do whatever you want with. You could give some to supporters as rewards, earn them back through various methods, and if/when you want to sell some of them, you could do that.
