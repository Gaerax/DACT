# Digital Adult Content Token
#### A Cryptocurrency token for the Adult Games and Art Community



# This sound complicated...

I know right!! It can seem overwhelming, but using it is actually very easy... This is a quick demonstration of how simple it would be for someone in your community to use this token.

## Creating a wallet.
In this example we will be using goby, a browser extension based crypto wallet. There are several different wallets that you can use, goby is just one option that does a good job of showing how simple all of this can be.

### Just install goby in google chrome

It really is just that simple.

## What will this look like?

We will create 1 billion of this new token, and set up a system to distribute them over time. The 1 billion tokens will be divided to create two systems. One will designed in a way that supports current and future creators for decades to come. The other will be set up to support community growth, platform development, and other fun stuff.

The goal of this is to help form a fun, light hearted, and open economy between creators and their audiences.

## What will this economy look like
Creators will be encouraged to distribute some of their tokens to their Patreon subscribers and other supporters as rewards. Creators would also offer their audiences various products, services, and just silly, fun things to do in exchange for these token. Platforms like spicygaming.net, myself, and other software developers in the community will create tools and services to make things easier for creators and more fun for the community.

## How will creators make money with this?
The token will be worthless when it is created. It's value will come from it's use, and as demand for the token grows. Tokens are are a [zero sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) Which basically means the price goes up when people want to buy, and down when people want to sell. So the questions are "Who wants to buy, and why?" and "Who wants to sell, and why?"

It is basic supply and demand. Because of the Creator Fund and partially through the Community Fund, a large community of individual creators will hold and control most of the supply, so they will benifit the most, as they should, they are the ones. If outside investors, or players want to buy more of the token, they will have to buy it from us, because we have the supply. It is the balance between buy pressure and sell pressure that determines the price of the token. This is a bit complicated, but that is how markets work. On an individual level, you as a creator would be given a chunk of the token that you can do whatever you want with, give some to supporters, earn more through various methods, and if/when the price goes up, you would decide if/when you might want to sell some of them.
