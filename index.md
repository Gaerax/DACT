# Digital Adult Content Token
#### A Cryptocurrency Token for the Adult Games and Art Community

There is a lot of concern going around about how Patreon views adult content, and what would happen to us if Patreon decided to ban the content that we create. I think everyone is right to be worried, most of us rely very heavily on Patreon and we have almost no control over our futures. Patreon could ban any one of us, or all of us at any moment, and there is almost nothing we could do to stop them. I also don't have faith that Steam, or any other platform would be any different. Even though the content that we create is totally legal, the credit card companies, and platforms like Patreon have complete control over us. They stand between us and our customers, and there is real alternative to dealing with them. If we want to continue to exist, and to secure our futures I think it is important that we slowly move towards something owned and controlled by us for us. 

There is a lot of negative opinions and criticisms around cryptocurrencies, some of it is valid, some of it is misguided. It is a very complicated and nuanced convesation. I would like you to put aside any negative opinions and imagine what this could be for us, and not focus on the dumpster fire that is the majority of the crypto world. I believe that if we work together we can create a system that is much better than the Patreon model that we have now.

I believe that the best way to create this new system is creating a cryptocurrency token for our community. I would like to share my plan for what this system could look like, and to get more people on board with this idea, because something like this will only work if it is a large and collaborative community effort.

## What is a cryptocurrency token?
A token is basically a cryptocurrency that is easy to create. They are created using the platforms created by real cryptocurrency projects. We would create our own token to be used in a new economy between all of us creators, and our audiences. This token would have all of the features and functionality of a real cryptocurrency, without the complicated software development that goes into creating a cryptocurrency from scratch.

Basically, it is magic internet money that we can do whatever we want with.

## This sound complicated...

I know right!! It can seem overwhelming at first, but it is actually very easy to use it... This is a quick demonstration of how simple it would be for you and your followers to use this token.

In this example we will be using goby, a browser extension-based crypto wallet. There are several different wallets that you could use, goby is just one option that shows how simple all of this can be.

### Just install goby in google chrome

### Open goby, and set a password

### Create your wallet

### Write down your private mnemonic, and keep it safe.
It can be used to access this new wallet from anywhere, even if your computer is lost or destroyed. (Don't share it with anyone, they could use it to steal everything in the wallet)

### And, that's it...
This is your new address, which can be copied and shared publicly with anyone who wants to send you tokens

And when you have tokens, you can easily send them to anyone elses address.

It really is just that simple.

## What will this project look like?

We will create 1 billion of this new token, and set up two system to distribute them over time. One will be designed in a way that supports current and future creators for decades to come. The other will be set up to support long term community growth, platform development, and other fun stuff.

The goal of this is to help form a fun, light hearted, and open economy between creators and their audiences.

## What will this economy look like?
Creators will be encouraged to distribute some of their tokens to their Patreon subscribers and other supporters as rewards. Creators would also offer their audiences various products, services, and just silly, fun things to do in exchange for these token. Platforms like spicygaming.net, myself, and other software developers in the community will create tools and services to make things easier for creators and more fun for the community.

This economy would not immediately make us rich, or replace our existing income streams. It will mostly just be a fun way to reward our supportors and get more community engagement. However, over time, as more people get involved and this economy grows, demand for the token will rise.

## How will creators make money with this?
The token will be worthless when it is created. It's value will come from it's use, and its price will go up as demand for the token grows. Tokens are are a [zero sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) Which basically means the price goes up when people want to buy, and down when people want to sell. So the questions are "Who wants to buy? Who wants to sell? And why?" It is basic supply and demand.

Because of the Creator Fund (and the Community Fund) a large community of individual creators will hold and control most of the supply. Therefor, they will benifit the most, as they should. If outside investors, or players want to buy more of the token, they will have to either earn it by supporting us, or buy it from us, because we control the majority of the supply. It is the balance between buy pressure and sell pressure that determines the price of the token. This is a bit complicated, but that is just how markets work.

On an individual level, you as a creator would be given a chunk of the Creator Fund for free that you can do whatever you want with. You could give some to supporters as rewards, earn them back through various methods, and if/when you want to sell some of them, you could do that.
